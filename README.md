## Overview
The Cybersecurity Analyzer simulates network traffic and system logs, detects anomalies using machine learning algorithms, and provides **intelligent, structured explanations** and recommendations using **Gemini AI**.  
This project is ideal for security teams, researchers, or students exploring **AI-driven cybersecurity systems**.

---

## Features
- 🔹 **Network & Log Simulation**: Generate realistic network traffic and logs for testing.  
- 🔹 **Anomaly Detection**: Detect potential threats using machine learning algorithms.  
- 🔹 **Severity Scoring**: Assign severity levels to detected anomalies.  
- 🔹 **RAG + Gemini Integration**: AI-powered structured explanations with threat type, known attack status, and recommended actions.  
- 🔹 **Pretty-Printed Output**: Industrial-grade, readable output with color-coded severity and actionable recommendations.  
- 🔹 **Multi-Agent Friendly**: Designed for full-stack agentic AI integration.  

---

## Tech Stack
- **Python 3.11+**  
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn, IsolationForest, etc.  
- **AI & LLMs**: Google Gemini API, Sentence Transformers, RAG-based knowledge retrieval  
- **Database / Storage**: ChromaDB for knowledge base embedding storage  
- **Utilities**: dotenv, colorama, pandas

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/cybersecurity-analyzer.git
cd cybersecurity-analyzer
````

2. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Add your Google Gemini API Key in a `.env` file:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

---

## Usage

Run the analyzer:

```bash
python main.py
```

The system will:

1. Simulate network traffic and logs
2. Detect anomalies
3. Assign severity
4. Retrieve knowledge from the embedded KB
5. Use Gemini AI to generate structured threat analysis
6. Pretty-print the results

## Output Example

```
🚀 Starting Cybersecurity Analyzer with Simulation + RAG + Gemini
[SIM] Generate network traffic -> data/network.csv
[SIM] Generated logs -> data/logs.csv
Anomaly Result: 1, Severity: 2

🧠 RAG + Gemini Explanation:

--------------------------------------------------
🔎 Severity Level: 🟡 Medium
⚠️  Threat Type:  Brute-Force Attack
✅ Known Attack:  Yes

🔒 Recommended Actions:
   1. Lock accounts after multiple failed login attempts
   2. Enable multi-factor authentication (2FA)
   3. Monitor and block suspicious IP addresses
--------------------------------------------------
```

---

## Future Improvements

* Real-time network monitoring integration
* Dashboard for visualization of anomalies
* Multi-language support for Gemini explanations
* Automated alerting system (email/SMS) for critical threats

I can also create a **shorter “marketable” version** for GitHub that looks like a product page, with badges, screenshots, and demo GIFs if you want.  

Do you want me to make that too?
